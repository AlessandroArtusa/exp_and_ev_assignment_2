          Welcome! Thank you for taking part in our experiment, the purpose of
          this test is to investigate whether people read faster identifiers
          written in <b>camelCase</b> or in <b>kebab-case</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test will show an initial short sentence to read. The next step
          consists in choosing from 4 identifiers the one that corresponds to
          the sentence previously visualized,
          <b>do this as quickly as possible!</b>
          <br />
          Half of the identifiers will use camelCase, the other half kebab-case.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gently ask you to fill in the form in the next page, after that,
          the test will begin.
